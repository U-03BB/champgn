# ChamPGN

ChamPGN provides a convenient way to view Chess games and puzzles stored in the [PGN file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).

You can view on a chessboard any of the stored positions and continue playing legal moves, as well as consult the commentary and move lists included in the PGN for each game (or toggle hiding them to avoid puzzle spoilers ðŸ˜‡).
